Repo for the "Intro to Reinforcement Learning" Class @ DSR

### Slides for the class
* The slides for the class are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vfdCLFse1Z8pocViCO5kI-sJrWYLjQGmvYj8r1bb2ds/edit?usp=sharing)

### Set-up of OpenAI gym, the python library for Reinforcement Learning on the command line
`pip install gym==0.7.0`
#### to check the installation, you can tape 'import gym' in a python terminal
#### if this does not work, you can clone directly the repository with the following commands: 
* `cd`

* `cd gym`
* `pip install -e '.[all]'`
#### If you want, you can also create a conda environment and then install gym on it: 
* `conda create --name rl-env python=3.6 anaconda`
* `source activate rl-env`
* `pip install gym==0.7.0`
